# DeepLabV3 Image Segmentation with Foreground-Background Separation and Text Addition

This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained DeepLabV3 model from the `torchvision` library for semantic segmentation, separating the foreground and background of an image. Additionally, it allows adding custom text to the background, making it useful for various applications such as image editing or creative content generation.

## Features:
- **Semantic Segmentation:** Using a pre-trained DeepLabV3 model with ResNet-101 backbone to segment the image into various categories (e.g., person, animal, background, etc.).
- **Foreground-Background Separation:** The foreground and background of the image are separated based on the segmentation map.
- **Text Overlay:** Customizable text can be added to the background of the image, allowing for further creative manipulation.
- **Visualization:** The original image, segmentation map, foreground, and background with text are displayed using `matplotlib` for easy visualization.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch and torchvision
- PIL (Pillow)
- matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation:
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deeplabv3-image-segmentation.git
cd deeplabv3-image-segmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:
1. Make sure to replace the `image_path` variable with the path to your image.
2. Run the script to perform segmentation, separate the foreground and background, and add text to the background.
3. The results (original image, segmentation map, foreground, and background with text) will be displayed using `matplotlib`.

```bash
python segmentation_script.py
```

## Example Output:
- **Original Image**
- **Segmentation Map** (using a jet color map)
- **Foreground Image** (only the segmented foreground)
- **Background with Text** (background with customizable text added)
